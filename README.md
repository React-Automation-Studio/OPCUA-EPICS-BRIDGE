# Introduction 

OPC UA is a service-orientated communication architecture  that supports platform-independent, data exchange between
embedded microcontrollers, PLCs or PCs and cloudbased infrastructure. This makes OPC UA ideal for developing
manufacturer independent communication to vendor specific PLCs, for example. With this in mind, we present
an OPC UA to EPICS bridge that has been containerized with Docker to provide a microservice for communicating
between EPICS and OPC UA variables.

Figure 1 shows how the system may be deployed with multiple EPICS clients communicating to two PLCs though two OPC UA EPICS bridges.


# SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The microservice is written in Python and 
containerized with Docker. We make of the dbtoolspy project, Python SoftIOC project and OPCUA-asyncio modules to implement the system. 
The Docker environment variables determine the uniform resource locator (URL) of the OPC UA server, the subscription rate, the EPICS record file to use,
and whether to connect securly to the server.

The microservice loads EPICS records that describe the relationship between the OPC UA and EPICS variables. The system connection to the OPC UA server and creates an EPIC IOC for the variables. We link between the OPC UA Client variables and the EPICS IOC PVâ€™s data change callbacks based on the information loaded db fle. The callbacks perform type checking, and type cast the new values between the data types used internally in the OPC UA and EPICS.

If no exceptions occur, then the bridge is kept alive indefinitely. If an exception occurs, for example, if the PLC is rebooted, a connectivity exception will be thrown and the bridge service will exit.

When the microservice is stopped or an exception occurs, the system will exit. All the listening EPICS clients will therefore get a channel access (CA) exception notification. If the microservice is configured to restart, then connectivity will resume on the EPICS CA when the new instance of the bridge establishes connection.

# CONFIGURATION AND DEPLOYMENT
The system is designed to be orchestrated with Docker Compose, although any other orchestration system such as Kubernetes can be used by porting the configuration file. Example YML configuration files are available in root folder.



Prerequisites: git, latest version of docker-ce and docker compose 

( At the time of writing the system used Docker V23.0.3 and docker compose V2.17.2 )

To install docker-ce  and docker compose on Unbuntu follow:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

It is advised to the follow the Post Installation steps for Linux:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/


1st clone this repo, with the --recurse-submodules option :

SSH:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:React-Automation-Studio/OPCUA-EPICS-BRIDGE.git

```
or

HTTPS: 
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/React-Automation-Studio/OPCUA-EPICS-BRIDGE.git

```


# 2 Launching the Docker compose files
There are several docker-compose configuration files.

## Python Unsecure Server 
Firstly bring up the Python demo unsecure OPCUA server in a terminal. Itbundle a Python OPC UA  server and the bridge together.

In the root folder run:
```bash
docker compose  -f example-unsecure-localserver.yml  up --build
```


This will load an opcua  server test variables and the Epics bridge with variables declare in the db/test.tb

The Epics process variables can then be access via any Epics client such as caput, caget and cainfo for example or through a the GUI available at:

https://github.com/wduckitt/React-Automation-Studio-Example-OPCUA.git


You can also use UAexpert to verify if the server is running on:
 opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/
